                        Ionela is ecstatic to live at Ligia's Orphanage. She is so happy to belong to a family and can't believe she's already
                        lived here for so many years. Unfortunately, she was born into a family burdened by many financial difficulties, and God
                        changed her life completely when she came to Ligia's Orphanage. All of her sad days have been replaced wtih smiles, sunshine,
                        and kindness. She is being taken care of. She can put her parents' neverending fighting in the past. She treasures having her
                        own room and desk where she does her schoolwork. She enjoys warm-cooked meals cooked with love by the staff. She is thankful
                        for clean clothes and shoes provided by generous sponsors at Ligia's Orphanage.

                        Marco arrived with his sister to Ligia's Orphanage after their mother was admitted to Bethany Home in Hateg.

                        But now, the siblings are both happy to be at Ligia’s Orphanage.  He says, “We are very happy to be here because we feel safe.  We are loved and protected, and we celebrate our birthdays.  We are also happy because we have gotten to know God better.  We received such a warm welcome from Ligia’s Orphanage and are receiving a good education.”

                        Alexandra is a beautiful girl and, from all appearances, no different from the other children at Ligia’s Orphanage. 
                        Her inner world is entirely different - a world in which sounds are absent. 
                        Alexandra is deaf-mute and has been ever since she was born.  She never heard or uttered a word. 
                        For most of her life, she hasn’t received adequate treatment or care and was not taught how to communicate. 
                        When we saw her condition, we simply couldn’t just walk by. 
                        With the help of God and the support of people willing to lend a hand, Alexandra goes to a special needs school and is able to get the help she needs.

                        Berta is a beautiful girl filled with much love for those around her. 
                        She is more mature than the other children. 
                        As the oldest sibling, she took on some of her mother’s responsibilities. 
                        She gets sad and nostalgic when she starts talking about her mother. 
                        “My mother was young and beautiful, but she had to go abroad in order to work to make money. 
                        Our home was always cold and dirty. 
                        There was never anything to eat. 
                        Our mother thought it would be better for us if she went away for work and left us to be raised by our aunt”. 
                        But Berta’s aunt was not able to look after the children, so they ended up in the “system” for a while before coming to Ligia’s Orphanage.  Berta says, “I am happy to be here where I finally have a real home. 
                        I can study at my own desk. I have books, school supplies, and a backpack. I am happy to finally enjoy a peaceful life”.

                        Since December 2011, Ligia’s Orphanage has been where Luca calls home.  When he thinks of his mother, he gets sad and nostalgic.  His mother had to go abroad to work in order to make a living.  He remembers their former home being cold and dirty, and there was never anything to eat.  So his mother decided it would be better if she went away to work and left her children with their aunt.  However, his aunt could not take care of them either, so the children ended up in the “system” before coming to Ligia’s Orphanage.

                        Codruţ is Berta’s little brother.  Berta desperately wanted her brothers to grow up with her at Ligia’s Orphanage. Since they were little, their mother abandoned them, and Codrut was placed with a family that he grew very attached to.  Although he didn’t have many memories of his siblings, blood proved thicker than water, and he chose to come to Ligia’s Orphanage to live with his siblings.  Codrut is extremely happy to discover new worlds during his studies.  He loves to play while he lives at Ligia’s Orphanage.

                        Darius was separated from his Mom at a very early age.  He came from a large family of five children.  His oldest sister Berta insisted that Darius join her at Onesimus Brother House, which is how he came to call the orphanage home.  He is a very hardworking student, eats well, and has educational and emotional support.  In his own words, ”I feel like I belong here, and I truly enjoy everything I have been given here. I can learn and study, play with my siblings, live in a comfortable, cozy home, and have everything I could not get at home.”

                        Melisa is a beautiful and happy person who always wears a smile on her face.  She came to Ligia’s Orphanage when a young man from Timisoara became concerned about Melisa’s family’s living conditions.  She lived in poverty with her mother in a village near Timisoara.  Often she had nothing to eat and was left alone because her mother spent a lot of time at the hospital.  Eventually, she ended up in Child Protective Services and, from there, went to Ligia’s Orphanage.  Little by little, her life began to change for the positive, and she now wants to grow up and have a family of her own.  She has finished high school and will start college at the University of West, in the area of Social Assistance.  Her dream job is to help others in need.

                        Andrei came to Ligia’s Orphanage because of a young man who was worried about him.  When he was little, he lived in poverty with his mother in a village not far from Timisoara.  Often he had nothing to eat and was left unattended because his mother spent a great deal of time in the hospital.  Andrei was left in the care of his grandmother, who could only do so much for him.  Andrei was taken to Child Protective Services in Timisoara and, from there, went to Ligia’s Orphanage.

                        Cristian has beautiful eyes and a smile on his face that instantly wins over all of the people that he meets.  He came to Ligia’s Orphanage when a young man from Timisoara became concerned about his living conditions and helped him.  After a short amount of time, Cristian now calls Ligia’s Orphanage home.  It is a place where he feels love and protection.  He goes to school and has many dreams of what he will be when he grows up.  He says, “I am happy to have a wonderful family and good conditions for learning.  I can play.  I can study.  I have food, clothes, school supplies, and everything I could ever need.  I am really happy here!”

She is sad that her mother was not able to raise her and her mother is similarly sad to be separated.  Because her mother could not afford to raise them, she pleaded with “Jesus Hope of Romania” to take in all her children.  She wished that her three children would grow up together, and they have been at Ligia’s Orphanage for a few years now.
For some time, Maria faced health issues, and Ligia's Orphanage took excellent care of her while she was at the hospital and at home.  With their help, she is healthy.  Maria appreciates all of the blessings she receives at Ligia’s Orphanage.

                        Flavia is one of the “wonder kids” of Ligia’s Orphanage.  She was brought to the orphanage at the age of 2 by her birth mother, Mara.  Mara was diagnosed with AIDS and passed away shortly after giving birth to Flavia at the age of 23.  Towards the end of her life, Mara accepted Jesus Christ as her Lord and Savior, and Flavia was given up for adoption to Ligia’s Orphanage.  Flavia is thankful for her home, where she found unconditional love.  She dreams of becoming a singer.  Because of her natural talent for singing, she finds herself the lead singer for various programs organized at Ligia’s Orphanage.

                        Gabriel’s life was filled with hardship and sorrow until he eventually mustered up the courage to ask his neighbors for help.  He started talking to officials in the village where he lived with his sister, mother, and grandmother.  Eventually, he ran away from home to avoid the frequent beatings from his mother.  For a while, he slept on the hay in his neighbor’s barn.  The neighbor could not stay indifferent to Gabriel’s situation and alerted local authorities.  Gabriel was taken to Child Protective Services and was later entrusted to Ligia’s Orphanage.  He is grateful for being taken care of and for the love that surrounds him every day.

                        What Emilia remembers about her parents: “Our parents did not live together.  Our father lived with his parents, and our mother lived with her mother.  Our house had no electricity because our mother stopped paying the bills.  She was very mean to us.  She used to beat us using anything she could find within reach.  We had to clean the house and prepare the meals.  We would bring in water from outside using a bucket to wash our clothes.  Our mother took all of the money she received from the state for us and used it for her own good.  And quite often, there was nothing to eat.”  Emilia started attending school while living at Ligia’s Orphanage and is determined to do well in her studies.  She is happy to find people who offer her love, a home, and daily care - all of these to make up for the many days she was abused and hungry.

I began reading the Bible and going to Christian camps.  It was in one of these camps that I decided to follow God all of my life. I realized that I couldn’t do anything without Him.  On July 19, 2020, I confessed Jesus to be my Lord and Savior, and I got baptized.  I have been the happiest ever since.”

                        In December 2011, Alexandru came to know Ligia’s Orphanage as his home.  He has very few memories of his parents, and those few he has about his mother bring him sadness and nostalgia.  He remembers his mother was young and beautiful.  She had to go abroad for work and left Alexandru in the care of an aunt.  The problem was that the aunt was also unable to raise him financially, so she asked Child Protective Services to care for Alexandru.  He was in the care of the Romanian state for a while until “Jesus Hope of Romania” came to save the day.  JHOR was just starting Ligia’s Orphanage and agreed to take Alexandru in.
