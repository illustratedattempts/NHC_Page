                        Ionela is ecstatic to live at Ligia's Orphanage. She is so happy to belong to a family and can't believe she's already
                        lived here for so many years. Unfortunately, she was born into a family burdened by many financial difficulties, and God
                        changed her life completely when she came to Ligia's Orphanage. All of her sad days have been replaced wtih smiles, sunshine,
                        and kindness. She is being taken care of. She can put her parents' neverending fighting in the past. She treasures having her
                        own room and desk where she does her schoolwork. She enjoys warm-cooked meals cooked with love by the staff. She is thankful
                        for clean clothes and shoes provided by generous sponsors at Ligia's Orphanage.

                        Marco arrived with his sister to Ligia’s Orphanage after their mother was admitted to Bethany Home in Hateg. 
                        The siblings keep in touch with their mother, who is ill.

                        At first, Marco thought he wouldn’t like it at Ligia’s Orphanage because he was so attached to his mother. 
                        But now, the siblings are both happy to be at Ligia’s Orphanage.  He says, “We are very happy to be here because we feel safe.  We are loved and protected, and we celebrate our birthdays.  We are also happy because we have gotten to know God better.  We received such a warm welcome from Ligia’s Orphanage and are receiving a good education.”

                        Alexandra is a beautiful girl and, from all appearances, no different from the other children at Ligia’s Orphanage. 
                        Her inner world is entirely different - a world in which sounds are absent. 
                        Alexandra is deaf-mute and has been ever since she was born.  She never heard or uttered a word. 
                        For most of her life, she hasn’t received adequate treatment or care and was not taught how to communicate. 
                        When we saw her condition, we simply couldn’t just walk by. 
                        With the help of God and the support of people willing to lend a hand, Alexandra goes to a special needs school and is able to get the help she needs.

                        Berta is a beautiful girl filled with much love for those around her. 
                        She is more mature than the other children. 
                        As the oldest sibling, she took on some of her mother’s responsibilities. 
                        She gets sad and nostalgic when she starts talking about her mother. 
                        “My mother was young and beautiful, but she had to go abroad in order to work to make money. 
                        Our home was always cold and dirty. 
                        There was never anything to eat. 
                        Our mother thought it would be better for us if she went away for work and left us to be raised by our aunt”. 
                        But Berta’s aunt was not able to look after the children, so they ended up in the “system” for a while before coming to Ligia’s Orphanage.  Berta says, “I am happy to be here where I finally have a real home. 
                        I can study at my own desk. I have books, school supplies, and a backpack. I am happy to finally enjoy a peaceful life”.

                        Since December 2011, Ligia’s Orphanage has been where Luca calls home.  When he thinks of his mother, he gets sad and nostalgic.  His mother had to go abroad to work in order to make a living.  He remembers their former home being cold and dirty, and there was never anything to eat.  So his mother decided it would be better if she went away to work and left her children with their aunt.  However, his aunt could not take care of them either, so the children ended up in the “system” before coming to Ligia’s Orphanage.
